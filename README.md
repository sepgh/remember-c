# Remember C

I'm very new to C programming language. Well, here I am trying to note down some concepts as I am learning them so that I remember them better (hopefully) :thinking:.


## Intro

Since I was familiar with programming (mostly in Java) the basic syntax of C wasn't hard to follow.

The playlist below was how I refreshed my memory of C syntax (plus introdution to `&`address, `*`pointers and `struct`).

[C Programming Tutorials - Caleb Curry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_c9BZzLwBRKKqOc9TJz1pP0ASrxLMtp2)

Next playlist that I am going through right now is called [The C programming language made easy - Code Vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypG9W33LOTk&list=PLfqABt5AS4FmErobw8YyTwXDUE5nPH5lH&index=1)
I was introduced to the playlist when I wanted to learn more about memory management in C and I found it to be facinating.

There are more playlists that I will check out next (or maybe sooner), but of course I will skip what I already know. Here they are:

## Content

### Decimal representation of a binary number

Get a binary number as input (ex: `1001`) and print the decimal value (ex: `9`).

## Void pointer

Imagine we have a function that takes in "an int array" and "int of length of the array" to represent eatch array element in hex format. How can we modify this function to accept other types like `long long` or `short` instead of only `int array`.
