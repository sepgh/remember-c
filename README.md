# Remember C

I'm very new to C programming language. Well, here I am trying to note down some concepts as I am learning them so that I remember them better (hopefully) :thinking:.


## Intro

Since I was familiar with programming (mostly in Java) the basic syntax of C wasn't hard to follow.

The playlist below was how I refreshed my memory of C syntax (plus introdution to `&`address, `*`pointers and `struct`).

Next playlist that I am going through right now is called [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypG9W33LOTk&list=PLfqABt5AS4FmErobw8YyTwXDUE5nPH5lH&index=1](The C programming language made easy - Code Vault)
I was introduced to the playlist when I wanted to learn more about memory management in C and I found it to be facinating.

There are more playlists that I will check out next (or maybe sooner), but of course I will skip what I already know. Here they are:
